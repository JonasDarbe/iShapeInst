## Abstract

In this paper, we propose an efficient, real-time, and fully convolutional framework instance segmentation for irregularly shaped objects, called iShapeInst. Irregularly shaped objects are widely existing in daily life and industrial scenes, and they are usually thin, curved, or with complex boundaries. The
prior instance segmentation methods rarely focus on irregularly shaped object, which drops dramatically for performance. This work improves the instance segmentation pipeline, proposing each pixel instead of the center of the object to predict kernel weight. Then, low-quality kernel weights of objects are filtered by employing metric learning and kernel fusion. Finally, instance masks are produced by convolution operation between kernel weights and mask feature. Specifically, at the training stage, iShapeInst applies regions instead of dense centers for instance to locate multiple kernel weights positions of the object. All kernel weights are dynamically optimized by metric learning and kernel fusion, which enforce intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy. At the inference stage, high-quality kernel weights of instances are generated by kernel fusion, and the prediction is obtained by convolution operation with mask feature map and Matrix NMS operation. Experimental
results show that iShapeInst can achieve state-of-the-art performance on six types of irregularly shaped object datasets, surpassing existing methods by 22.3% mmap and obtaining 31.5 FPS processing speed. We hope iShapeInst can serve as a strong baseline of instance segmentation for irregularly shaped objects.
